Vikings Fan Log - Week 1

The season opener was absolutely electric! U.S. Bank Stadium was rocking from the opening kickoff. 
The crowd was so loud during third downs that the opposing offense couldn't even hear their own signals.

Justin Jefferson looked unstoppable out there - every route was crisp, every catch was spectacular. 
This is going to be our year, I can feel it!
