Vikings Fan Log - Tailgate Edition

The parking lot was absolutely buzzing with energy this morning! 
Purple and gold everywhere you looked. The smell of bratwurst and burgers filled the air, 
and you could hear the SKOL chant echoing from every corner of the lot.

Met some amazing fans from all over Minnesota - some drove 4 hours just to be here! 
That's the kind of dedication that makes Vikings Nation special.

The energy is building as we head into the stadium. This crowd is going to be LOUD!
